* About
Allows user to specify commit/tag in source block header. If :dir is specified, =ob-with-commit.el= will try to checkout a commit in the specified directory. If not, it will test current directory for a git repo.

Example:

#+begin_src bash :vc v0.1 :dir /path/to/code
/path/to/code/script
#+end_src

This is a series of hacks, relying heavily on shell-command-to-string, put together very quickly. This is meant to be a proof of concept, and it works for the cases that I tested. Feedback welcome!
* Wishlist
- [ ] handle "remote" vc commands gracefully
- [ ] Automagically detect vc, abstract away checkout commands
- [ ] Make dir accept remote paths
* Load file
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-file "ob-with-commit.el")
#+end_src
